It sounds like you have a project plan to create new Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) containers in a new resource group, move data from old containers to the new ADLS containers, and update your code to point to the new location. Here's a general outline of the steps you would typically follow:

### Step 1: Create New ADLS Containers

1. **Create New Resource Group**: If you haven't already, create a new resource group in your Azure subscription to organize your new ADLS resources.

2. **Create New ADLS Gen2 Containers**: In the new resource group, create new ADLS Gen2 containers that will hold your data. Make sure to set the necessary access controls and permissions.

### Step 2: Move Data to New Containers

1. **Data Migration**: Migrate the data from the old containers to the new ADLS Gen2 containers. You can use tools like Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Sync, or Azure Storage Explorer to copy the data.

### Step 3: Update Code to Point to New Location

1. **Update Connection Details**: Modify your code to use the new ADLS Gen2 container locations and update the connection details (e.g., URLs, credentials).

2. **Test Code**: Thoroughly test your modified code to ensure that it correctly interacts with the new ADLS containers.

### Step 4: Deployment and Validation

1. **Deploy Updated Code**: Deploy the updated code to your environment. Make sure you have proper testing and deployment procedures in place to avoid any disruptions.

2. **Validation**: Perform thorough validation to ensure that the code is working as expected with the new ADLS container locations.

### Step 5: Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerts to keep an eye on the behavior of your application after the migration. Ensure that data transfers, access, and costs are as expected.

2. **Maintenance**: Maintain documentation and communication channels to address any issues that might arise after the migration.

Remember, this is a high-level overview, and the actual implementation might involve more detailed steps based on your specific environment, tools, and requirements.

Additionally, while updating your code, make sure to update the following aspects to point to the new location:
- URLs or endpoints used for accessing the ADLS containers.
- Any authentication or credentials required to access the new containers.
- Any paths, directories, or folder structures used within your code.

It's also recommended to collaborate closely with your development, operations, and data management teams to ensure a smooth transition and minimize potential issues.
